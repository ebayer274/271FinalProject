This Project is a Jupyter Notebook along with a paper describing and exploring harmonic motion.
Starting at the simpliest case, a mass on a spring, one can see how simple harmonic motion can turn into chaos.
Later, the effects of different initial conditions and how they impact the time it takes for the system to become chaotic are explored.
